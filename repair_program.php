        <h1>Owner Occupied Repair Loans</h1>
        <p>HFHMR offers owner occupied repairs through the following programs.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Exterior Repair</h2>
        <h3>A Brush With Kindness (ABWK)</h3>
        <p>The ABWK program is a partnership program to help eligible families who need assistance with small exterior 
            repair jobs, exterior painting, outside tidiness and other such assignments. All of the work is completed
            by volunteers. The homeowner pays for most of the materials &mdash; never to exceed 5% of their monthly
            income. If we paint the home's exterior, the paint base is free, but the cost of tinting is paid for 
            by the homeowner.
        </p>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>HFHMR, in coordination with other volunteer agencies and organizations, can build wheelchair ramps for 
            eligible families. Homeowners pick up the cost for the materials and HFHMR provides the volunteer labor. 
            Some limited 0% interest loans, with manageable monthly payments, are available. Materials for wheelchair
            ramps cost about $25 per linear foot.
        </p><br>
        <p>Porches, decks, siding, and window replacements are also exterior repair projects.</p><br>
