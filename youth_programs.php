        <h3>What is a youth group build?</h3>
        <p>A youth group build is any youth group that wants to volunteer together to make a difference in the community.
            Generally, a youth build lasts for 3-4 hours and can include painting, landscaping, or building decks. If 
            your group wants to volunteer, just contact our office to get started with your team building opportunity.
        </p>
        <h3>How old do I have to be to volunteer on a house site?</h3>
        <p>It is the policy of Habitat for Humanity that children under the age of 16 are not allowed on the work 
            site while there is any construction in progress. Minors 16 and 17 years of age are allowed to participate
            in general construction; however activity such as the use of power tools, excavation, demolition, or working
            at heights above 12 feet is not permitted until age 18. Volunteers between the ages of 14 and 16 can paint or
            do landscaping on the construction site, as long as no construction is occuring.
        </p>
