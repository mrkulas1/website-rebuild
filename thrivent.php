        <p>Through the Thrivent Choice&#174; program, members can help direct where Thrivent Financial distributes 
            part of its charitable outreach funds each year. By directing Choice Dollars&#174;, eligible Thrivent 
            members can recommend which nonprofit organizations they feel should receive charitable grant funding 
            from Thrivent. IF you have Choice Dollars&#174; available to direct, please consider directing Habitat 
            for Humanity Menominee River.

        <h1>Thrivent Action Teams</h1>
        <p>Thrivent members have an opportunity to help build even greater impact by forming Action Teams to support 
            Habitat's work on site or off.
        </p>
        <h3>What are the guidelines?</h3>
        <p>Thrivent Action Teams are all about activating Thrivent members to live out our mission on the ground in 
            your own way - around the needs in your local community. Here are some simple guidelines to consider when 
            planning your projects:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Involve others &mdash; It's about your friends, family and your community coming together to serve to 
                have a greater impact.</li>
            <li>Not a gift or grant &mdash; Use the seed money to purchase project supplies and promotional materials 
                to make your project a success.</li>
            <li>One Action Team, one project &mdash; Multiple Thrivent Action Teams cannot be used for the same project;
                you can support the same cause, but use your creativity to generate new project ideas to attract more 
                volunteers and have an even greater impact!</li>
            <li>Report &mdash; Share your stories, photos and participant infor with us after your event. This must be 
                completed before applying to lead your next Thrivent Action Team!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Approved Action Teams receive $250 in seed money for project expenses (up to two times per year) along with
            T-shirts and other promotional items. Beyond additional funding, teams have the ability to grow awareness
            and invite others to become involved.
        </p>

            Habitat office at (906) 779-5377 or email <a href="mailto:hfh@habitatmr.com">hfh@habitatmr.com</a>. To
