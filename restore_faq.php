        <h1>ReStore FAQs</h1>
        <h2>Are all the items for sale in the store donated?</h2>
        <p>No. While most of our items are donated, we do have items that have been purchased by us or are put up by
            employees as consignment.
        </p>
        <h2>If I buy a big item, can you deliver it for me?</h2>
        <p>No. The ReStore no longer offers a delivery service to customers with larger items. It is the customer's 
            responisibility to load and transport all items they purchase.
        </p>
        <h2>I have items to donate, do you have anyone who can pick them up?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Please call the ReStore to make an appointment.</p>
        <h2>Do you take TVs?</h2>
        <p>We do not take older TVs. If it is a flat screen in good working condition, we may accept it at our discretion.</p>
        <h2>Can I take a tax deduction for my donations?</h2>
        <p>If you itemize deductions on your federal tax return, you may be entitled to claim a charitable deduction for
            your ReStore donations. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a taxpayer can deduct the fair 
            market value of household goods, used furniture, books and so forth. Fair market value is the price a 
            willing buyer would pay for them. Value usually depends on the condition of the item. By law, a charity cannot
            tell you what your donated items are worth. This is something you must do yourself. To assess "fair market value"
            for your donations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consult a local tax advisor who should be familiar with market values in your region</li>
            <li>Review the following tax guides available from the IRS</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Determining the Value of Donated Property</h3>
        <p>Defines "fair market value" and helps donors and appraisers determine the value of property given to qualified
            organizations. It also explains what kind of information you must have to suppor the charitable contribution
            deduction you claim on your return. (Publication 561)

        <h3>Charitable Contributions</h3>
        <p>Explains which organizations are qualified to receive deductible charitable contributions, the types of

        </p>
        <h3>Noncash Charitable Contributions</h3>
        <p>Applies to deduction claims totaling more than $500 for all contributed items. If a donor is claiming over 
            $5,000 in contribution value, there is a section labeled "Donor Acknowledgement" in Section B, Part IV of 
            IRS Form 8283 that must be completed. The form and instruction are available on the IRS site and can be 
            accessed through the following link <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8283.pdf" target="_blank">IRS Tax Form 8283</a>
            . A member of the management staff must verify that the donation receipts match the completed form adn fill
            in the date of donation/s in this section. In addition, the ReStore's name (Habitat for Humanity 
            Menominee River ReStore), store address and identification nubmer (38-3095570) must be completed.
            Management staff must also provide their signature, title, and the signature date. Finally, a copy of 
            completed Form 8283 should be forwarded to the Merchandise Analyst.
