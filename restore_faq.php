        <h1>ReStore FAQs</h1>
        <h2>Are all the items for sale in the store donated?</h2>
        <p>No. While most of our items are donated, we do have items that have been purchased by us or are put up by
            employees as consignment.
        </p>
        <h2>If I buy a big item, can you deliver it for me?</h2>
        <p>No. The ReStore no longer offers a delivery service to customers with larger items. It is the customer's 
            responisibility to load and transport all items they purchase.
        </p>
        <h2>I have items to donate, do you have anyone who can pick them up?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Please call the ReStore to make an appointment.</p>
        <h2>Do you take TVs?</h2>
        <p>We do not take older TVs. If it is a flat screen in good working condition, we may accept it at our discretion.</p>
        <h2>Can I take a tax deduction for my donations?</h2>
        <p>If you itemize deductions on your federal tax return, you may be entitled to claim a charitable deduction for
            your ReStore donations. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a taxpayer can deduct the fair 
            market value of household goods, used furniture, books and so forth. Fair market value is the price a 
            willing buyer would pay for them. Value usually depends on the condition of the item. By law, a charity cannot
            tell you what your donated items are worth. This is something you must do yourself. To assess "fair market value"
            for your donations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consult a local tax advisor who should be familiar with market values in your region</li>
            <li>Review the following tax guides available from the IRS</li>
        </ul>
