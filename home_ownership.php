        <h1>Home Ownership</h1>
        <p>HFHMR of Iron Mountain-Kingsford, MI is a community-based organization that works to eliminate poverty housing
            in Dickinson and Iron Counties. We do this by buidling and selling simple decent homes to qualified families.
            To keep the costs reasonable, HFHMR relies on local volunteers to build homes and change neighborhoods. 
        </p>
        <p>HFHMR has the following requirements for home purchase qualifications.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Need</h2>
        <p>A potential HFHMR family must show they have a need for new housing. A family can show need in several ways.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Current living conditions are substandard</li>
            <li>Current living conditions are too small for the family's needs</li>
            <li>The home creates a financial hardship for the family</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Willingness to Partner</h2>
        <p>Families must be willing to partner with HFHMR while their home is being built. Specifically, each adult 
            member of the family must volunteer 200 hours to the building of the home.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Ability to Pay</h2>
        <p>A HFHMR mortgage is about $1,000 per month. An applying family must be able to show that they can afford
            this payment. In addition, family income may not exceed these maximum income guidelines (60% AMI).
