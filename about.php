        <h1 class="about-header">About Habitat for Humanity Menominee River</h1>
        <p>We are a faith based Christian nonprofit housing ministry.  We believe in helping our neighbor by giving a hand up...
            not a hand out.  There are three components to Habitat for Humanity -- partner families, volunteers, and donors.
            All three are needed to successfully accomplish our goal of eliminating substandard housing in our community.  We
            offer three programs -- home ownership, neighborhood revitalization, and the Habitat ReStore.</p>
        <h1 class="about-header">Our Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>Habitat for Humanity Menominee River works in partnership with God and people everywhere to serve families in need.
            We build and renovate houses while improving neighborhoods to help create communities where people are able to live
            and grow to their full potential.</p>
        <p>Veterans served for all of us, and we are proud to partner with veterans and their families and perform critical
            home repairs and accessiblity renovations to ensure that they have a safe place to live.
        </p>
        <h1 class="about-header">Our Story</h1>
        <p>Locally, the Menominee River affiliate has started its 51st house since its founding in 1994.  Our homes are built
            to Energy Star and Green Build standards, which results in lower utility bills for our families.  Three of our 
            recent homes were rehabs of donated houses.</p><br>
        <p>Partner families purchase their home with an affordable mortgage.  The money from the mortgage payments in used 
            by the affiliate to construct or renovate additional housing as well as funding our neighborhood revitalization
            program.  We are audited annually.</p>
