        <h1>About My Donation</h1>
        <h3>Will my donation dollars remain local?</h3>
        <p>The money that we receive is used locally to build and renovate homes.</p>
        <h3>If I give to Habitat, how do I know that my donation is being used appropriately?</h3>
        <p>We are audited every year by an independent auditor. Donors and potential donors can be assured we are good 
            financial stewards of thier gifts. Financial information is available upon request.
        </p>
        <h3>If I give to Habitat, either monetarily or by volunteering, will I be pressured to give to other charitiess?</h3>

            sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. Your personal information is confidential.

        <h3>I don't want to be publicly recognized. Will that be a problem?</h3>

            for gifts of money and in-kind support will be sent to all donors.

        <h3>If I give once to Habitat, will I keep getting asked to give more money?</h3>
        <p>While we welcome donations at any time, we have historically done our "ask" right before Christmas through 
            our Holiday Letter.
        </p>
        <h3>How much of my donation will go to actual building supplies?</h3>
        <p>According to our most recent audit, 83 cents of every dollar received goes to actual construction. Seven 
            cents goes to fundraising and 10 cents goes to administration.
        </p>
        <h3>I have items to donate to the ReStore that won't fit in my car. What do I do?</h3>
        <p>While the ReStore encourages donations to be dropped off during business hours, we will do donation 
            pick-ups. All of our pick-ups are done by trained ReStore personnel. Be prepared to provide information 
            on the types of items you wish to donate and an estimate on the size of the pick-up. This information
            allows the ReStore to efficiently schedule pick-ups. All items to be picked up must be on ground level 
            and large items must be outside the house. ReStore employees are not responsible for removing items from 
            the inside of your home.

        <p>Your donation to Habitat (a 501c(3) non-profit organization) is tax deductible as allowed by law. 
            You can use your cancelled check as proof of your donation. If you donate items to the ReStore, you 
            will receive a receipt for the items donated. The ReStore will not put an y dollar value on your 
            donated items.

        <p>We welcome the opportunity to talk with you if you have interest in volunteering with Habitat, so we can 
            see how your skills and interests mesh with our needs. Experience is not necessary, just a willing 
            attitude and a desire to help. Professional staff are at the construction site to guide volunteers.

            also invest 200 hours per adult in sweat equity (labor) on their house.
