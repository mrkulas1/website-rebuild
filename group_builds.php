                ever tried these activities with a group of your peers? How would you trust each other, communicate 
                togethner, adn develop and implement a plan? Here is your chance to find out! Our home construction
                projects provide challenges that require teamwork, open communication and creative problem solving.

            <h2>Women's Build</h2>
            <p>A home construction site can be intimidating for some women. It's the number one reason why they don't
                volunteer. To overcome this problem, we hold an annual Women's Build. The event is sponsored by Lowe's,
                and is a women only experience that has helped us to complete 19 homes in a friendly, safe, and 
                non-threatening environment. Over the years, hundreds of women in Dickinson and Iron Counties have 
                participated in every phase of construction, and everyone leaves the site with real construction 
                experience and a host of new friends.
