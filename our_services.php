        <h1>What We Do</h1>
        <p>We are a faith based Christian nonprofit housing ministry. We believe in helping our neighbor by giving a hand 
            up... not a hand out. There are three components to Habitat for Humanity &mdash; partner families, volunteers,
            and donors. All three are needed to successfully accomplish our goal of eliminating substandard housing in 
            our community. We offer three programs &mdash; home ownership, neighborhood revitalization, and the Habitat
            ReStore.
