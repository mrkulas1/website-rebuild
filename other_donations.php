        <ul>
            <li>Cash, check, or credit card &mdash; These gifts provide an immediate impact on HFHMR</li>
            <li>Matching Gifts &mdash; Many employers as well as investment companies such as Thrivent Financial

            <li>Bequests &mdash; A gift to HFHMR through a will or bequest provides future support for the affiliate</li>
            <li>Life Insurance &mdash; By naming HFHMR as the beneficiary to a paid-up life insurance policy, a large gift 
                can be made with little or no financial impact to the donor
            </li>
            <li>Retirement Plan Assets &mdash; Naming HFHMR as the beneficiary of an IRA, 401K, Keogh, or other retirement 
                plan can result in an estate tax reduction for the donor
