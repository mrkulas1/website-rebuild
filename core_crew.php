        <h1>Core Crew</h1><br>
        <p>We have a dedicated crew of men and women who build the majority of our homes. They work Monday's and Wednesday's
            8:00am - Noon every week throughout the year. There's no experience necessary to join this crew. We even supply
            tools.</p><br>
        <p>The core crew is involved with everything.  They form and pour basements, raise walls, set trusses, place windows,
            run wires, hang drywall and cabinets, and install the trim. You can become a full time member or just help when
            you can. This important crew is our most valuable asset.</p><br>
        <p>To volunteer or receive more information about joining this critical group of men and women, please contact the
            HFHMR office at (906) 779-5377 or hfh@habitatmr.com.</p>
