        <h1>Volunteering in the ReStore</h1>
        <p>As a non-profit, the Habitat for Humanity Menominee River ReStore is always looking for good volunteers to help with
            daily operations.
        </p><br>
        <p>Contact the ReStore by calling (906) 774-2867 or by emailing <a href="mailto:restore@habitatmr.com">restore@habitatmr.com</a>
            for more information or to volunteer.</p>

            <h2>Mechanically Inclined?</h2>
            <p>If you love to take items apart and put them back together again, we would love to have you help us. Many of
                our donated items come in needing a little TLC, and this is a great way to volunteer time.

            <h2>Love to clean?</h2>
            <p>Many of our donated items would be benefitted by a good cleaning, and would be a perfect opportunity to get 
                involved with the ReStore.

            <h2>Love to organize?</h2>
            <p>Because we never know what or how many items are coming in each day, there is always a need to continue
                organizing and rearranging our showroom. If you have a passion for organizing things and would like to
                see the store look orderly, we would love to have you donate your time.
