        <h1>Volunteer for an Event</h1>
        <p>We have one main fundraising event each year, the "Raise the Roof" golf outing. We thank those who have 
            previously volunteered and are always looking for new volunteers.
        </p>
        <h2>"Raise the Roof" Golf Outing</h2>
        <p>Our 22nd annual "Raise the Roof" Golf Outing was a massive success that raised over $14,000 for our critical
            home repairs program. This program provides critical home repairs and remodels to families in need at a 0%
            interest loan. Our golf committee (Matt Lutz and Scott Zeuske) both worked incredibly hard to put the event
            on and make it successful, and did a fantastic job. If helping to put on a golf fundraising event is 
            something you would be interested, please call the office at (906) 779-5377 or stop in and let us know.
        </p>
        <p>A huge thank you to our golf committee, to all our sponsors for helping to make this event possible, and for
            all the participants for supporting our community and providing the fun.
        </p>
        <p>Our 23rd annual "Raise the Roof" Golf Outing will be held on Thursday, May 29th, 2025 at TimberStone Golf Course.</p>
