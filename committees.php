        <h1>Committees</h1>
        <p>
            It's informative to view Habitat for Humanity Menominee River not as a monolithic organization that moves as 
            one, but as a collection of interrelated committees that help move the affiliate towards our goal of 
            eliminating poverty housing and improving communities. Each committee is an independent body of volunteers
            that works within defined areas of responsibility. Together we are HFHMR.
        </p>
        <p>
            This independence allows volunteers the freedom to find the area where they most want to contribute. A 
            retired contractor may best share their skills in the construction committee. A volunteer with a sales 
            and marketing background may want to help with our ReStore or Fundraising committee. Finding the right 
            place for your skills is our first priority.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you're an individual, small group, a large business, or other caring organization, there are 
            many ways to become involved in HFHMR's work. Volunteers can join any number of committees. To volunteer
            for these committees or to become a member of our team, stop by our office at 113 S. Milwaukee Ave,
            Kingsford, or contact us at <a href="mailto:hfh@habitatmr.com">hfh@habitatmr.com</a> or (906) 779-5377.

            <h2>Construction Committee</h2>
            <p>As you might expect, this committee oversees every facet of our home construction and rehab efforts.
                Their responsibilities range from selecting home sites, to approving blueprints, to overseeing 
                construction budgets. This important committee swings the hammers and keeps our affiliate focused
                on our most visible characteristic.

            <h2>Family Selection/Family Support Committee</h2>
            <p>Our primary mission is to offer eligible families an opportunity to buy a simple, decent home. 
                This committee's responsibility is to find, screen, and support families that fit HFHMR's 
                definition of "eligible". This committee must find families that are willing to partner with us,
                are able to shoulder the financial responsibility of a mortgage, and have a real and obvious 
                need for a new home. It's not an easy task. This committee screens more than fifty applicants for 
                every family that's approved.
            </p>

        <div class="grid3">
            <h2>Fundraising/Volunteer Committee</h2>
            <p>This is the "queen bee" committee. Everything HFHMR does starts and ends with fundraising. 
                Everyone on our team gets involved with this committee in one way or another. Whether you help
                with our grant writing team or help to run our golf outing fundraiser, there is a place for you.
            </p>

        <div class="grid4">
            <h2>ReStore Committee</h2>
            <p>Our ReStore is unlike any other commercial business. We are a non-profit entity, but are tasked
                with making a "profit." We walk a tight line between our two primary missions: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide affordable goods to our customers</li>
                <li>Raise money for the affiliate</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our ReStore manager is quick to complement the members of this committee with inventory control
                ideas, budget oversight, pricing limits, store layout, and other facets of the organization.
                To help with this committee, contact our ReStore manager, Crystal VanHese at 
                <a href="mailto:restore@habitatmr.com">restore@habitatmr.com</a> or stop into the ReStore.
